An app I would like to create is an informational accessibility app that allows students to report and view accessibility issues on campus. Examples of reported issues could include:

“Construction in front of Langdale’s west entrance; sidewalk blocked.”
“Library South elevator is out of service.”
This app would save time for students who rely on these areas to get to class by allowing them to plan their routes in advance. It would also provide a sense of stability and inclusivity on campus.

Features:
Quick Reporting with Prefilled Forms

Students can easily report issues using prefilled dropdown menus and quick response options to avoid typing long descriptions. For example:
Type of Issue: [Elevator down, Construction, Ramp blocked, Other]
Location: [Select from a map or list of campus buildings]
Details (Optional): A text field for additional notes.

Issue Tracking & Updates

Users can subscribe to updates on specific issues to be notified when they are resolved. For example, students could get a push notification when an elevator is fixed.
Categorization of Reports

Reports will be categorized for easier navigation (e.g., Entrances, Pathways, Elevators, Ramps, Restrooms, Parking). This categorization allows users to quickly filter and find relevant information.
Crowdsourced Accuracy

Other students can upvote, downvote, or confirm issues to ensure accuracy and relevance. For instance, if multiple users confirm a blocked pathway, it gets highlighted as a verified issue.
Accessibility Prioritization

The app will prioritize accessibility in its design, including voice-to-text functionality for reporting, screen reader compatibility, and high-contrast visuals.
Administrative Integration

Reports can optionally be forwarded to campus facilities or the accessibility office, enabling quicker resolution of issues.

## Notes

No issues building app :)
